# Common-Sorting-Algorithms-In-Java
## Project Summary:
I programmed common sorting algorithms in Java. The _Sorts file has the actual implementation for all the sorting algorithms which include 
insertion sort, merge sort, quick sort, a modified quick sort, and cocktail sort. The _RuntimeAnalysis file contains code that measures the runtimes for these
sorts given a certain number of trials. The _SortsTester file has tests which test all the sorting methods.
 
This project utilized a conceptual understanding of how the different sorting algorithms work.

Testing was done using J-Unit testing.
